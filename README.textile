h3. Introduction

    Solid|matter is an open source 3D-CAD application for product design.

    It is planned to feature parametrical, solid-based modeling, 
    a sketcher with associative dimensions
    and basic simulation of assembly kinematics.

    It is also designed to integrate well with the Gnome desktop.

h3. Getting the source code

   _git clone git://github.com/syntheticore/solidmatter.git_
   _cd solidmatter_
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3. Installing dependencies

    You need several packages to use Solid|matter:
    ruby 1.8, ruby-gnome2, rmagick, gtkglext, libglade
    
    You can usually install these using your package manager.
    
    On Ubuntu for example, just type:
    _sudo apt-get install gtkglext libglade ruby-gnome2 ruby-rmagick_
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3. Running the application

    For the moment the program cannot be properly installed. 
    To try it out locally, just cd to the topmost directory 
    and type _./bin/solidmatter_.
    
    Be aware that Solid|matter is currently <b>completely unusable</b> for actual
    work. It is still in its early phases of development and surely more
    exciting for people interested in helping out development, than for actual
    end-users.
